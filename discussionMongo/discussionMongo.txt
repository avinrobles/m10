Database
- Collection of data that are arranged and organized in a meaningful way

Data vs Information

let theBeatles = ['Richard','Gringo','John', 'Paul']

let childBirthYear = [1990, 1986, 2023]

let shakespeareQuote = 'To be or not to be, that is the question.'

{
	name: 'Michael Jordan',
	championship: [1990,1996,1990,2002],
	draftYear: 1984,
	draftPosition: 3
}

DATABASE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
- Allows us to manage/manipulate databases. We could perform basic CRUD operations on our databases.

What is CRUD?
CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Delete
	
Relational Database
- Allow to store data or information and arrange it in a meaningful table
- Data is arranged and store in tables of rows and columns

id	name	price
1	PS5	27500
2	PS4	16000

SQL
- Structured query language. It is typically used to programmatically manage/manipulate a relational database.

ERD
Mini-Activiti

In the m10 folder, create an activity folder.
Go to diagrams.net and link your professional gmail account.
Using the given set of entities and attributes, create an ERD that will show the relationships between the collections:

Order Item
Order ID
Product ID
Quantity
Price
Sub Total

Products
Name
Description
Price
Stocks
Is Active?
SKU

Users
First Name
Last Name
Email
Password
Is Admin?
Mobile Number


Orders
User Id
Transaction Date
Status
Total

Screenshot the diagram and paste it in our discussion mini-activity




Create a mock data for each of the following collection using JSON syntax.


Collection: "Order Item"
[
	{
		"Order ID": "A24",
		"Product ID": 7079,
		"Quantity": 1,
		"Price": 500,
		"Sub Total": 50
	}
]

Collection: "Products"
[
	{
		"Name": "PS5",
		"Description": "Video Game Console created by Sony",
		"Price": 29990,
		"Stocks": 50,
		"Is Active?": true,
		"SKU": "A2469420"
	}
]

Collection: "Users"
[
	{
		"First Name": "Avin",
		"Last Name": "Robles",
		"Email": "avinrobles@gmail.com",
		"Password": "password12345",
		"Is Admin?": false,
		"Mobile Number": 09999866420
	}
]

Collection: "Orders"
[
	{
		"User ID": "09272002",
		"Transaction Date": "4/20/25",
		"Status": Active,
		"Total": 35000
	}
]

=====================
Data Model
-  Describes how data is organized or group in a databse

Data Modeling Simulation
- Login
	- users
		- admin
		- users
			- guest users
			- users

Create Data Model
	- Users
		- admin
		- customer
			-- first name
			-- last name
			-- mobile number
			-- email
			-- password
			-- is Admin?
			-- enrollments
		- courses
			-- name
			-- description
			-- price
			-- is Active
			-- enrollees

Relationships between data models
	- one-to-one = one can only have one (one person has one ID)
	- one-to-many = one can have one or more (emails)
	- many-to-one = multiple people can only have one (Authors doing one Research)

Translating data models into an ERD
	ERD
		- Entity-Relationship Diagram
			- Explains the relationship between entities and their attributes to 				other entities.

====================
SQL
	- structure query language
	- it is a language used typically in relational DBMS to store, retrieve and modify data

SELECT id, first_name, last_name FROM students WHERE section = 1;

NoSQL
	- Not Only SQL

db.students.find({section = 1}, {id: 1, firstName: 1, lastName: 1})

	- was conceptualize when capturing complex, unstructured data 
		- MongoDB
MongoDB
	- open-source database and the leading NoSQL database, it's language is highly expressive and generally friendly to those familiar with JSON structure
		- "Mongo" in MongoDB is a part of word "humongous" which means huge or enormous

		- tables ==> collections
		- rows ==> documents
		- columns ==> field
